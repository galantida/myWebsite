Most are invisible in the final product. I decided what better place could there be to store 3D printed junk then in a 3D printed dumpster.",

      "text": "At the time this was my largest 3D print. It took almost an entire spool of blue PLA and ran for about 36 hours. It also shifted a few times partway through the print. The caused a staggered stepping pattern between the layers. It was almost as if the belt slipped but they were on tight. In my opinion the steps were too regular to be a random slip so it seemed like a rounding issue. I had done a number of prints without rebooting the 3d printer and adding an additional thirty six hours on top of that is a very long time. I now make sure to reboot the machine every day or so and it hasn't happened since.",
