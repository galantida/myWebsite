      "text": "I have a pudgy face which normally pushes the mask strings outward and makes my ears stick out. It is also uncomfortable. Now I use this strap extender and it pulls the mask down to the back of my neck instead of up to my ears. It fits tighter on my nose and it is much more comfortable.",
